hello! my name is @maximilianosinski, i'm too curious and that leads to me **digging around in places** where i'm probably **not** **authorized**, is that a mistake? i don't think so, because i've learned a lot in reverse engineering, programming and much more on a professional level with 3,5 years of experience.
so if you want to know how a system works feel free to ask me, email: maximilianosinski@maxeman.com. i have explored the undocumented Spotify API, TIER Mobility API, Google Translate API, Instagram API, YouTube API and many others almost entirely.

of course i also offer myself to do certain projects or you can hire me directly, just send me an email.
